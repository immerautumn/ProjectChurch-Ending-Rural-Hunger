# Project C.H.U.R.C.H: Christians Helping the Underserved with Resources, Care, Hunger.
#### Ending Rural Hunger:
- This is software designed to...
    - streamline the IT/Infrastructure of complex charity operations, involved in the distribution of food, clothing, toiletries, and other operations.
    - Creates extremely low-cost, cloud-enabled infrastructure, reducing start-up costs.
    - Easily auditable, from costs, to compliance for those who do take government assistance.
    - Creates a secure storage location for user data that is required for compliance, and basic anti-fraud detection.
    - Requires an AWS account, and a single IAM user with appropriate roles. (We don't recommend using a root user, but this can be done as well.)
    - Scripted installation. Can be stood up from anywhere so long as the requirements are met first.
    - Easily created and destroyed.
    - Documented: We're including a guide for administrators to gain a quick understanding of the code that's been shipped here, as well as an extremely permissive license for folks who want to customize their experience with additional components.
- This project aims to:
    - Help end rural hunger. Larger cities have more resources, from personel, to what they give. Small cities and towns do not have the same resources, and likewise do not have sophisticated infrastructure. This project is aimed at leveling the playing field.
    - Help administrators ship a 'deploy and forget' backend that realistically should never have costs exceeding 15 USD per month, which is competitive compared with the costs of hosting otherwise.
    - Simplifies the ingestion, storage, security, of said user data, with class leading cloud infrastructure, that is already fantastically secure to start with.

## Contributing: 
- Ship a branch, and contact us here using the built into tools. Pay attention to style, and always include documentation updates for what you produce. Techinically speaking, code is self-documenting, but there is a cost in translation, so I'd ask you to be considerate of others, and especially the target audience.
